V-REP simulator for the da Vinci Research Kit (dVRK)
====================
This repository has code related to daVinci Research Kit (dVRK) V-REP simulator.
**Under development!!!**

[**Check out our YouTube-Video, showing the V-REP Simulator in action**](https://youtu.be/_flffuIevbw)


# Install
The repository contains both some V-REP scenes and ROS code to control the simulated dvrk-ros
* Download V-REP from the official webpage: http://www.coppeliarobotics.com/
* To use the simulator with ROS download and compile the V-REP ROS interface as described in: https://github.com/CoppeliaRobotics/v_repExtRosInterface
* Compile the catkin workspace folder using catkin build tools, NOT catkin_make. Please don't use catkin_make.

# List of Folders:
* V-REP_scenes **[under development]** 
  * Contains the main dVRK scene (dVRK) and five different applications described in [1]
* V-REP_models **[under development]**
  * Contains some V-REP models of the robots (complete dVRK, PSM, ECM, standard needle driver tool, some phantoms)
* V-REP_catkin_ws **[under development]**
  * Contains the ROS code of some application scenes described in [1]
